# TODO

- Engine (lean4/grind): `internalize` does not share/canonicalize its argument
  (`Grind.add`/`addFactStep` likewise); the hash-consing invariant `mkEqProof`
  relies on is unmaintainable caller-side (accessor-obtained terms are only
  sometimes pointer-identical to session nodes, see Kraken.easm mechanism
  trace). Fix: `internalize` runs `preprocessLight`-class sharing itself;
  defense in depth: `mkCongrDefaultProof` treats the all-`isSameExpr` case as
  `rfl`. Reproducer: mkEqProof-panic-mwe.lean. Until then easm carries the
  workaround (preprocessLight before internalize).
- Engine (lean4/grind): directed fold of stratified equation chains
  (constant propagation / hypothesis-chain evaluation). Blocks: Sdyn.lean
  reload VCs (the remaining sorry), adc>=20 under finish, multireg under
  finish.
- Engine (vcgen): normalize `And` at Prop-valued preconditions to the lattice
  meet so the spec-authoring trap (raw `∧` stops the driver) disappears.
