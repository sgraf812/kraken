The original `swap` (three `xor`s exchanging `rax` and `rbx`), wrapped as a
procedure and called twice: the involution restores both registers, and the
stack pointer comes back to its entry value. `MachineWP.call_spec` links each
call to its return: the machine pushes the address behind the call cell, and
the callee's `ret` at that address continues the caller's run.
