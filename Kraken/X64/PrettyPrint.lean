/-- Renders a *closed* `Directive` expression as assembly text by running the
compiled `ToString Directive` instance on it. Returns `none` if the term is open or
cannot be evaluated (it mentions `sorry`, an axiom, a constant without executable
code, ...) so that callers can fall back to ordinary delaboration instead of failing
to pretty print the whole goal.

Why this is `unsafe`: a listing is only useful if it shows exactly the text the
backend emits, i.e. the pretty printer has to run the compiled `ToString` instance,
and the only way to run compiled code on an `Expr` is `Meta.evalExpr'`. That
function compiles `e` into a temporary definition, runs the generated machine code,
and `unsafeCast`s the result to the type it is given. The only check it performs is
that the inferred type of `e` is the constant `typeName`; nothing connects that name
to the Lean type, so an inconsistent pair yields a value with the wrong runtime
representation -- a segfault rather than an exception. That is why this function is
specialized to `Directive` rather than taking the type as a parameter: the pair is
fixed here, so no caller can get it wrong. (Running compiled code can also diverge
or perform arbitrary `IO`.)

Reducing `toString d` in the elaborator instead (`whnf`/`Meta.reduce`) would be
safe, but it does not work in general, because it needs every definition on the
print path to be definitionally reducible. Instruction directives happen to be
(`toString (Directive.instr ..) = "mov rax, 1"` is provable by `rfl`), but
`Directive.byteArray` prints via `ByteArray.toList`, which core defines by
well-founded recursion, so reduction gets stuck there. That leaves re-implementing
`ToString Directive` at the `Expr` level, i.e. a second copy of the assembly
printer that can silently drift from the real one.

The unsafety is contained the way core does it for tactic configuration
elaboration (see `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Config`): `directiveStrImpl` is the only `unsafe`
definition here and it is reachable only through the safe `directiveStr?` below,
whose logical model is "the pretty printer learned nothing". Only pretty printing
consumes the result, so a wrong or missing answer can never affect a proof. -/
